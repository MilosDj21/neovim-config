  If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
  a guide. One possible example:
  - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

  And then you can explore or search through `:help lua-guide`
  - https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
You should run that command and read that help section for more information.

In addition, I have some `NOTE:` items throughout the file.
These are for you, the reader to help understand what is happening. Feel free to delete
them once you know what you're doing, but they should serve as a guide for when you
are first encountering a few different constructs in your nvim config.

require('custom.settings')

-- [[ Install `lazy.nvim` plugin manager ]]
--    https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim
--    `:help lazy.nvim.txt` for more info
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/lazy/lazy.nvim'
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
  vim.fn.system {
    'git',
    'clone',
    '--filter=blob:none',
    'https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git',
    '--branch=stable', -- latest stable release
    lazypath,
  }

vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)

-- [[ Configure plugins ]]
--  You can configure plugins using the `config` key.
require('lazy').setup({
  -- Not required anymore, neovim does this since 0.10v but just in case i left it here in comment
  -- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
  -- { 'numToStr/Comment.nvim', opts = {} },

  -- NOTE: Next Step on Your Neovim Journey: Add/Configure additional "plugins" for kickstart
  --       These are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --       Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them.
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.autoformat',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    You can use this folder to prevent any conflicts with this init.lua if you're interested in keeping
  --    up-to-date with whatever is in the kickstart repo.
  --    Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.

  --    For additional information see: https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-structuring-your-plugins
  { import = 'custom.plugins' },
})

-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
